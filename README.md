# ECB Shifts

An Open-source ECB-shift.

This shifts characters' ECBs upwards, causing them to land when their knees or knee-equivalents touch the ground, like in Melee. This allows characters to waveland more effectively and to hit landing aerials much easier.

If you want to use this to your own enviorment then feel free it's not complex. if you need help reach out to me and I can do my best.

Credits to PhazoGanon, CSharp, and Black Calculus for the support and information for making all of this possible.
